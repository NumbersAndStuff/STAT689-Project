# STAT689-Project
This repository contains the following documents

-> The bulk of the code that runs the sentiment anlysis using `TextBlob`, `scikit-learn` and `NLTK` are located in `ProjectNotebook.ipynb`.

-> The implentation of SpaCy to lemmatize documents can be found in `TokenizeDatasets.ipynb`.

-> The final report with sample plots is located in `KaggleStat689Project.pdf`.

-> There are also various `.csv` files that are included for convenience.  These files can be create within the code or implemented here.

    -- train.csv is the file downloaded from Kaggle, cleaned of extraneous data for size
  
    -- *_parsed.csv are files that include lemmatization to avoid the need to run the tokenization codes over and over
  
  -> Extra code that was used to explore `SpaCy` and `scikit-learn` are located in `ProjectTree.ipynb`.
